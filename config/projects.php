            3. Manageable: Once an investment is finished, it won't need constant attention as a live thing would. The most you will have to do is occasionally check on your land to make sure encroachers don't take possession of it.<br/>
            4. Passive income: Rent could be a source of passive income once someone has invested in real estate. Investors purchase built real estate or develop undeveloped land, then rent it out to generate income continuously throughout the year.<br/>
            5. Non-depreciable Asset: When done correctly, real estate investing is a type of business that never loses value. Every year, the value of real estate rises. Additionally, if a sizable public or private project is launched nearby, the value may rise dramatically.
