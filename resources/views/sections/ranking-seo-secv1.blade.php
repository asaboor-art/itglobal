					<h2>Ranking & Visibility</h2>
					<p>Ranking is the term used to describe both the method used by search engines to determine the order of URLs on the search engine results page (SERP). How prominently a piece of material appears in search engine results is referred to as search visibility. More search traffic results from material that ranks in the first few slots. Search engines use ranking factors—often changing, frequently contested criteria—to choose which search results to display on a page. Your ability to develop an SEO plan and increase organic traffic depends on your ability to comprehend how search engines evaluate and rank content.</p>
