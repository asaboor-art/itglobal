					<p>While paid advertising, social media, and other online channels can drive traffic to websites, search engines account for the vast majority of all online traffic.</p>
					<p>In comparison to paid adverts, organic search results garner many more hits, take up more digital space, and seem more trustworthy to sophisticated searchers. For instance, only 2.8% of  searches result in a sponsored ad click.</p>
					<p>In a word, SEO offers 20X more potential for visitors than PPC, both on desktop and mobile.</p>	
					<p>In addition, SEO is one of the only online marketing strategies that, when executed properly, may yield results over time. Your traffic can grow over time if you provide high-quality content that deserves to be found for the relevant keywords, as opposed to advertising, which requires ongoing spending to drive visitors to your website.</p>
					<p>In order for your material to be correctly indexed and presented in search results, optimising your site will help give better information to search engines.</p>
